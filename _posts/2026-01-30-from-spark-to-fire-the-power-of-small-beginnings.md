Many times, we are deceived into thinking that we need to have many things in place before we can start something, whether it’s achieving a goal, beginning a project, or pursuing any meaningful change. But you don’t need to have it all figured out to start. All you need is a little fire, something you can ignite and fan into flames. 🔥

The book of James 3:5 says that a great forest is set on fire by a little fire. Another version says a little spark. This is not a fable; it’s exactly what happens during wildfires. Just a little fire, a little spark to start with, and a whole part, or even the entirety, of a forest can be set ablaze.

At times, when God gives us a vision, or when we’re trying to grow spiritually especially at an early stage when we are obviously far from where we want to be, we may think of doing extreme things like 40 days of fasting and prayer or studying the Bible nonstop for two hours daily. But this is something you haven’t even been doing half of before. Start small but you won’t stay small.

Let me use myself as an example. A few years ago, I decided to read my Bible every single day. Then I heard of people who read ten chapters of the Bible daily. Instead of allowing this to pressure me, I allowed it to inspire me. That was how I decided to start with just one chapter of the Bible each day. After one to two years, I began reading more than one chapter daily.

Remember, it started as a little fire—reading just one chapter of the Bible each day. Over time, and over the years, it grew into a bigger fire, including a consistent daily devotion.

This is how growth happens. One thing I’ve discovered is that growth isn’t sudden; it happens steadily. As the old saying goes, slow and steady wins the race.

Friend, I want you to take this with you: pick a life-improving habit, no matter how small, and follow it through until you become consistent. Those little steps are what take you closer to your God-given purpose.

Thank you.
God bless you. 😁
