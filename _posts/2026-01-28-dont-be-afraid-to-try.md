Don’t be afraid to try.

It occurred to me that the reason many of us get stuck at some point in life is simply because we fail to try. And one major reason for this is the fear of failing.

But 2 Timothy 1:7 reminds us: *“For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.”*

This takes me back to something that happened to me some time ago. I needed a new ATM card, but I was reluctant to go because of the time (a Friday afternoon) and the stress I expected—queues, bank wahala, you know the drill. A typical Nigerian can relate 😂.

I eventually decided to go. To my surprise, all I had to do was use a machine close to the ATM stand, and few of interacting with it, I had a new ATM card. I was genuinely happy and relieved. 😌

That experience taught me something important: **try, even when you think you might fail.**

Don’t be afraid of trying!
